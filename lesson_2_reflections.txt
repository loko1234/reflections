    The repository is being associated with the current dierctory. I need it,

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    Working directory = local copy, aka files that exist in PC (and are OR are not versionised)
    Staging area = buffer, aka files in working directory marked as changed, but they do not exist yet in the repository

    Repository = all the files here are versionised
