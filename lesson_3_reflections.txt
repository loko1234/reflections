When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    As a backup.
    To share something with others
    To work simultaneously on open source projects etc. with others. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    It makes sense to pull changes from a remote when ever one decides that these changes 
    are constructive and not destructive. Automatical updates could create chaos.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking: Cloning a persons repository within Github servers to my account. Then doing changes without affecting his original repository.
    Cloning: Copying a repository local to local, or remote to local
    Branches:  Having multiple paths and making changes in them without affecting each other, or the master path. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is good for the project's progress to be allways updated with the steps and thoughts of the collaboratives.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I 'd be sing dropbox. It would be harder, under the circumstance that I 've learned git and GitHub I suppose.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Freedom of experimentation without fearing the rest of the code gets destroyed.
